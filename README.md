# Deconvolve

This is a set of scripts to aid in deconvolving signals. In particular, the set of scripts here helps in deconvolving two signals: one comes from a BCS superconductor, and the other comes from some 1D system. Specifically, the signals are their respective density states, which are convolved because electrons are tunneling, and the resulting differential conductance signal is proportional to the density of states.

Here, the deconvolution procedure is performed by optimizing the square of the error.
